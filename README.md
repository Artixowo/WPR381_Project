# Community Portal Project

## Project Overview

This is a **Community Portal Website** built for the WPR37(8)1 Group Project. The portal includes five fully functional pages: **Home**, **About**, **Events**, **Contact**, and **Thank You**. Each page is rendered using dynamic content with EJS templates. The website was developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**, with a focus on partial reuse, and modular routing.

The portal allows visitors to:

All form submissions are stored in an in-memory array for demonstration purposes.
